# KRAS inhibition in model of Lung Cancer -- H358 cell line

## Experimental Design

 - PE 150 RNAseq
 - 3x DMSO exoRNeasy v. 3x AMG exoRNeasy -- 2D
 - 3x DMSO exoRNeasy v. 3x AMG exoRNeasy -- 3D
 - 3x DMSO exoTIC v. 3x AMG exoTIC -- 2D
 - 3x DMSO exoTIC v. 3x AMG exoTIC -- 3D

## Goals

    1. Compare performance between exosome isolation approaches in both 2D and
       3D contexts
    2. Identify differentially expressed genes between 2D/3D and AMG/DMSO
    3. Assess global transcritpome representation in all contexts

## To-Do

    [ ] Differential Expression
    [ ] Clustering
