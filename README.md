# KRAS inhibition in model of Lung Cancer -- H358 cell line

## Experimental Design

 - PE 150 RNAseq
 - 3x DMSO exoRNeasy v. 3x AMG exoRNeasy -- 2D
 - 3x DMSO exoRNeasy v. 3x AMG exoRNeasy -- 3D
 - 3x DMSO exoTIC v. 3x AMG exoTIC -- 2D
 - 3x DMSO exoTIC v. 3x AMG exoTIC -- 3D

## Goals

1. Compare performance between exosome isolation approaches in both 2D and 3D contexts
2. Identify differentially expressed genes between 2D/3D and AMG/DMSO
3. Assess global transcritpome representation in all contexts

## To-Do

- [ ] Differential Expression
- [ ] Clustering

# Notes

Things that go up in both 2D/3D for rnaEasy:

    GPR85 - Most conserved GPCR in vert. dev., implicated in schizophrenia
    RNU1-1 - snRNA, splicing
    DNM1P47 - dynamin pseudogene
    C12orf77 - who knows
    LINC01562 - TE-rich lncRNA antisense to RNF11
    RN7SK - RNA component of nuclear riboprotein
    FLRT2 - neuronal migration, FGFR2
    GREM1 - early dev, patterning, BMP antagonist maintains FGF4/SHH loop
    SLCO3A1 - solute carrier
    SPG7 - mitochondrial metalloprotease
    REXO1LP - pseudogene of REXO1 exonuclease
    PCDH9 - proto-cadherin, cell to cell neuronal stuff
    CCDC88A - actin-binding protein that is activated by the serine/threonine kinase Akt and plays a role in cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration. enhances Akt signaling by mediating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent activation of Akt by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors
    FP671120.6 - mysterious novel transcript that seems massively enriched in/specific to exRNA
    Z82195.3 - novel transcript that is, basically, L1HS
    XACT - lncRNA, x-chromosome activation during pluripotency
    AL360020.1 - mystery
    RN7SL1 - signal recognition particle of Andy Minn fame (exosome paper, breast cancer)
    AL512646.1 - mystery
    MALAT1 - pan-cancer lncRNA, bunch of connections to RAS but who is right and which is generalizable?
    EFL1P2 - pseudogene
    LSAMP - neuronal surface glycoprotein
    SYT15 - trafficking and exocytosis of secretory vesicles in non-neuronal tissues
